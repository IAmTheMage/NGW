# NGW

NGW stands for New Game Window, created to replace the previous version based on the following justifications:

- The old software is visually inefficient, utilizing few resources of QT and the ones it uses are used frivolously.
- The old software is a significant impediment to the team's development, being poorly documented, poorly written, and poorly understood by the team members themselves.
- Extensive bugs that lead to constant freezes and crashes for unknown reasons or reasons that should not cause crashes.
- Actions that should work but do not, such as reading and writing to files, serial ports, among others.

## Core Features

- Eficient
- Performatic

## Doubts

One of the major issues with the old Game Window's functionality was the lack of documentation regarding its own bugs and existing problems. This is expected to be addressed in this new implementation; however, as no software is exempt from them, this implementation may also have some bugs. As I am yet unsure where to document them, I will leave it open for now. Nonetheless, two possibilities come to mind: documenting the errors via Trello or documenting the errors directly here on Github.
